      VoiceCare is an innovative mobile healthcare application I developed to support visually impaired individuals in
      managing their healthcare needs independently. The system leverages voice technology to remove visual barriers,
      allowing users to perform essential tasks such as registration, login, and appointment booking entirely through
      Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) interaction. Built with Flutter and powered by Firebase Cloud
      Services, VoiceCare provides secure authentication, real-time data storage, and seamless synchronization between
      user and admin functions.
      The project focuses on accessibility-first design, featuring audio prompts, glowing focus indicators, and
      intelligent voice feedback to ensure a fully navigable experience without sight. By bridging healthcare and
      assistive technology, VoiceCare not only enhances digital inclusion but also aligns with the principles of
      universal design and equal access proving that technology can empower independence, dignity, and confidence for
      visually impaired users.
